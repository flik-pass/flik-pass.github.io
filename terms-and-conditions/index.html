    <h1>Flik - Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: August 11, 2024</em></p>
    
    <p>Welcome to Flik! Before you start using our amazing app, please take a moment to read through these terms and conditions. We know legal stuff can be boring, but we've tried to make it as painless as possible.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
    <p>Let's start with the basics. When we capitalize words, they have specific meanings:</p>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Application:</strong> That's us, Flik, the awesome app you've downloaded.
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Company:</strong> Also us, referred to as "We," "Us," or "Our."
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Country:</strong> We're based in France. Bonjour!
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Device:</strong> Whatever gadget you're using to access Flik.
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Service:</strong> The Flik application and all its cool features.
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>You:</strong> That's you, the amazing person using Flik!
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>By using Flik, you're agreeing to these terms. It's like a virtual handshake between us!</p>
    
    <p class="important">Important: You must be over 18 to use Flik. No exceptions, even if you're super mature for your age!</p>
    
    <h2>3. Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we might link to other websites. Just remember, we're not responsible for what happens when you visit them. It's like we're introducing you to a friend of a friend â€“ we hope you'll get along, but we can't guarantee it!</p>
    
    <h2>4. Termination</h2>
    <p>We hope it never comes to this, but we can terminate your access to Flik if you break these terms. It's like being grounded, but for apps.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>We do our best to make Flik awesome, but we can't be held responsible for every little thing that might go wrong. Our liability is limited to what you've paid us, or $100 if you haven't paid anything.</p>
    
    <h2>6. "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>We provide Flik as is. It's not perfect (though we think it's pretty great), and we can't promise it will meet every single one of your expectations.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of France. Oui, oui!</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We might update these terms from time to time. We'll let you know if we make any big changes.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Have questions? We'd love to hear from you! Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:flik.nft@gmail.com">flik.nft@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for reading! Now go enjoy Flik and all its awesome features!</p>
